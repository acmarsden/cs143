Please find a detailed account of the bug fixes in our regrade below. Line numbers refer
to those in the NEW cool.flex source file.

NOTE to us: diff made between the following commit hashes:
compare/f9e9cf1d04bd5ac6e412701ef52cd262deda5e9d...be52a8b9231cbb682f664100013a3d9cb7289cf0

1) L127-L128: We added a forward slash for lookahead in the regex, and make this rule finish
              discarding the rest of the line. 

2) L141: Since the newline char was already matched here, we should immediately return error, 
         instead of going into the STRERR condition. 

3) L146, L148: We forgot an else! When we should have been going to start condition STRERR
               because of string length, we ended up continuing to parse the string normally.

4) L224: We were not eating up stars inside comments, which were being printed to the output.

5) L245:  Some lines got accidentally deleted in our source (we're still clumsy with vim sometimes).
          We think that we could even have made all those different lines the match single valid characters
          only one LOC.

We understand the diff size is 7 LOC. However, this is partly due to stylistic choices in the source file. 
E.g. (1) would have been only 1 line, had we omitted the comment.

We do believe that our resubmitted cool.flex file fixes only a few minor errors and we hope you'll 
consider it a valid regrade. 
Fixing some other errors present in our lexer would have required more significant changes and would 
be definitely outside the scope of a valid regrade request.
